Backbone.ViewEvents â€” an alternative Events implementation for the Backbone.View
which provides events which bubble up through a view hierarchy while the latter
is inferred from DOM and the views' position in it.

Example:

  {View} = require 'backbone.viewevents'

  parent = new View().render()
  child = new View().render()

  parent.$el.append(child.$el)

  # register listener on parent
  parent.on 'someevent', (msg) ->
    console.log('caught!', msg)

  # trigger event on child
  child.trigger('someevent', 'hello')
