Backbone.ViewEvents â€” alternative Events implementation for Backbone.View which
provides events which bubble up through view hierarchy while the latter is
inferred from DOM and the views' position in it.

Example:

  {View} = require 'backbone.viewevents'

  parent = new View().render()
  child = new View().render()

  parent.$el.append(child.$el)

  parent.on 'someevent', (msg) ->
    console.log('caught!', msg)

  child.trigger('someevent', 'hello')
